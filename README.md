# RedwoodJS ToDo App (Following React Main Concepts)

I created this simple ToDo app with RedwoodJS, following guidance from the [Reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/) Main Concepts documentation.

In particular, I start by stepping through the [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) article.

You can walk through the development with me via a series of five [YouTube videos](https://youtu.be/Q4BnWK05H5w).

I am learning as I go, and I thought I’d capture my experience as a relative-newbie. (I’m capturing what I really wanted when I started out developing my first React app about a year ago - a glimpse at the grind and sausage-making of a day-in-the-life). So, hopefully it helps other relative-newbies :)

Cheers,

  Keith
